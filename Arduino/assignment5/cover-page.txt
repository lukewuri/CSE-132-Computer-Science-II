## Assignment Overview

What challenged you about this assignment?

The most challenging aspects of this assignment were primarily the section about java and
sending the inputs from java to Arduino. We felt this was difficult since it involved
some pieces of code/information that came from studios/optional parts of studios that
we did not completely finish.

What did you learn during this assignment?

We learned how to use morse code and also how to use an output stream from our PC to Arduino.

Were you unable to complete anything? Explain:

No.

Is there anything we should know about your work on this assignment:
Late coupon used for both partners.


## Assignment Questions

What is the Morse code encoding of the message "Hello world"?

.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..

We said in the writeup that we "cheated" on the normal rules for .h files
and .c files.  What could you do (don't actually do it, just describe it)
so that your morse sketch follows the rules strictly (i.e., no actual
executable code in a .h file)?

You would move the convertByte method to a .c file and remove it from the header file.
