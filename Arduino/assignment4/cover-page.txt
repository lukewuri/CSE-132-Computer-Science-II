## Assignment Overview

What challenged you about this assignment?
Coming up with the idea to use switch statements was challenging... until 
it was shown in one of the guides for that week. Also, converting data types
to make sure we had proper temperature readings (I kept getting 0 for awhile
because dividing by 1023 rounded the A/D reading to 0) was a little challenging.
What did you learn during this assignment?
I learned an implementation of case statements, how to send data from analog devices,
to Arduino, to Java. Also, the assignment helped me grasp hex and ASCII in
coding.
Were you unable to complete anything? Explain:
I do not feel like I left anything unfinished, although, I did feel that case 31 and 30
were a little pointless besides seeing if our connection was working between Arduino
and Java. Besides during the beginning, I did not use too many error reports when 
I wrote my assignment.
Is there anything we should know about your work on this assignment:
Late coupon was used.


## Assignment Questions

What is the meaning of a message that containts the following byte sequence?
"0x21 0x30 0x00 0x04 0x4f 0x6f 0x70 0x73"
"! 0 null end O o p s" ->> "! 0    O o p s"
Our temperature sensor works down to -40 degrees C.  If you receive the
following byte sequence, is the sensor above or below freezing?
"0x21 0x34 0x94 0x30 0x10 0x1f"
"! 40", the sensor would be above freezing.
