## Assignment Overview

What challenged you about this assignment?

The most challenging aspect of the assignment was using delta time and understanding
how to implement it. 

What did you learn during this assignment?

I learned that delta time was much more useful and practical than the delay function
and how to use the delta time. I also learned that crickets can be used to gauge temperature.

Were you unable to complete anything? Explain:

I do not believe I failed to complete anything.

Is there anything we should know about your work on this assignment:
The #define line would not work for me so I declared variables using 'const' instead.


## Assignment Questions

Dolbear's Law is an equation that gives you a temperature from a number of
cricket chirps in one minute. What is the equation that provides the chirp 
period given a temperature in Celcius?

Period = (60)/(7T-30). My work is shown in the comments of my ASSIGNMENT3FINALSDFSDFSDF.ino file.

Using the datasheet for your temperature sensor, the equation you derived
from it, and you knowledge of the Arduino, what is the expected `analogRead()`
value for 25 Celcius? 15 Celcius? Include any assumptions, like 
`analogReference()`, and a little bit of your work (an equation is fine).

At 25 Celsius, the analogRead() would be approximately (0.750 Volts)*(1023/1.1 V) = 697.5.

At 15 Celsius, the analogRead() would need some more calculation as the table does not give 
a voltage value at 15 Celsius. We use our equation T = 100(V) -50. Solving for Voltage, we get 
(T+50)/100 = V. Thus, when T = 15, V would equal 0.650 Volts. Now we can convert to the
analogRead() unit. (0.650 Volts)*(1023/1.1V) = 604.5.

What temperature range is the TMP36 specified for? How accurate is it in this
range? This can be answered looking solely at the overview and specifications
pages.

The TMP36 is specified for -40 C to 125 C. These are accurate to 10 millivolts as every
10 millivolts corresponds to 10 celsius. Since it covers a bigger range, it is not as accurate
if it accounted only for a 10 degree range. Aside from the scale factor and large range, it appears
that it is plus or minus 1 degree celsius in its readings.
